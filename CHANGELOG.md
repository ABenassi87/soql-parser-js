# Changelog

## 2.0.0

### Summary

Version 2.0 brings some significant bundle size and performance improvements. This library now uses [Chevrotain](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain) instead of [antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4). With this change, everything related to parsing had to be re-written from scratch. Chevrotain uses pure javascript to handle lexing, parsing, and visiting the generated ast/cst as opposed to using a grammar file and generating a javascript parser based on the grammar.

With this change, the data model was reviewed and analyzed, and there are some significant breaking changes to the data structures. Review the ðŸ”¥breaking changesðŸ”¥ below for a detailed description of each breaking change.

#### Bundle Size

To compare the bundle size, the following small program was written and then compiled using the default configuration of webpack, and the output bundle was compared.

- Version 1.x: **545kb**
- Version 2.0: **197kb**

```javascript
var soqlParser = require('soql-parser-js');

const query = soqlParser.parseQuery(`SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id = 'FOO'`);
console.log('query', query);
const soql = soqlParser.composeQuery(query);
console.log('soql', soql);
```

#### Benchmarks

Here is an example benchmark of parsing all the unit tests 1,000 times

```
OLD PARSER: ~6.2 seconds for ~60K parses
NEW PARSER: ~2.25Â seconds for 60K parses
```

### Breaking Changes ðŸ”¥

#### General Changes

- The CLI was removed.
- The `parseQuery()` `options` have changed. The only option allowed is `allowApexBindVariables` with will allow parsing queries with apex variables.
- `rawValue` will always have a space between parameters `GROUPING(Id, BillingCountry)`
- Some `literalType` values may have differing case from prior versions, regardless of the data input.
  - `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and all functions except those listed below will always be returned in uppercase, regardless of case of input.
  - **Exceptions**:
    - `toLabel`, `convertTimezone`, `convertCurrency` will always be in camelCase.
  - Added new available types for `DateLiteral` and `DateNLiteral`.
- A new `LiteralType` value was added for `APEX_BIND_VARIABLE`.
- When composing functions in a where clause or group by clause, the `rawValue` will be preferred (if exists) (no change here), but if rawValue is not provided, then the function will be composed using the `functionName` and `parameters`.
- A new `LiteralType` value was added for `INTEGER_WITH_CURRENCY_PREFIX` and `DECIMAL_WITH_CURRENCY_PREFIX`. e.x. `USD500.01`

#### Compose Query

- `getComposedField()` is deprecated, you should now use `getField()`. `getComposedField()` will remain available for backward compatibility.
- `getField()`/`getComposedField()` has the following changes:
  1.  `fn` property is has been deprecated (but still exists), you should now use `functionName` instead.
  2.  The `from` property has been removed for subqueries. The `relationshipName` is required to be populated to compose a subquery.
- On the FormatOptions interface `fieldMaxLineLen` was renamed to `fieldMaxLineLength`.
- Added support for `usingScope` - https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_using_scope.htm?search_text=format()

```diff
export interface FormatOptions {
  numIndent?: number;
- fieldMaxLineLen?: number;
+ fieldMaxLineLength?: number;
  fieldSubqueryParensOnOwnLine?: boolean;
  whereClauseOperatorsIndented?: boolean;
  logging?: boolean;
}
```

#### Parse Query

- `rawValue` will now be included on `Field` if `objectPrefix` is defined.
- `alias` may be included on `Field`, if defined.
- On `FieldFunctionExpression`, `fn` was renamed to `functionName`. this was done because all other usages of `fn` were `FunctionExp`, but it was a string in this case.
- The `parameters` type on `FieldFunctionExpression` was modified to allow an array of varying types.
- Removed `from` property from `FieldSubquery`.
- `having` was removed from `QueryBase` and now lives as a property on `GroupByClause`.
- On the `Condition` object, `literalType` may be an array. This will be an array if `value` is an array and there are variable types within the `value`. For example: `WHERE Foo IN ('a', null, 'b')` would produce `literalType: ['STRING', 'NULL', 'STRING']`.
- The `GroupByClause` has the following modifications:
  - `field` is now optional, and will be populated only if the grouping is on a single field.
  - `type` has been renamed to `fn` and will be populated when `CUBE` and `ROLLUP` are used.
  - The `having` clause has been moved as a top-level property to the `GroupByClause` and will be populated only if a `having` clause is present.
- The `HavingCondition` now has a `literalType` that will be populated with the type of the `value` property.
- `FunctionExp` has the following modifications
  - `text` was renamed to `rawValue` to be more consistent with other places in the data model.
  - `name` was renamed to `functionName`.
  - `parameter` was renamed to `parameters` and the type was changed to `(string | FunctionExp)[]` to support nested functions. This will ALWAYS be an array now even if there is only one parameter.
  - `fn` was removed, as nested functionParameters are always stored as an entry in the `parameters` array.
  - Added support for `usingScope` - https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_using_scope.htm?search_text=format()

### Changed

**!BREAKING CHANGES!**

- Added literal type information to fields to provide additional information about the field type. (#51)
  - WHERE clause fields have one of the following types `'STRING' | 'INTEGER' | 'DECIMAL' | 'BOOLEAN' | 'NULL' | 'DATE_LITERAL' | 'DATE_N_LITERAL';` stored in the condition.
  - For date literal fields that have variables, `dateLiteralVariable` will be populated with the value
- Modified Field data structure to have explicit type information. (#46, #52)
  - The data structure for fields has been modified to include specific information about the structure of a given field to ease making sense of a parsed query,
  - To aid in creating compose fields, a new helper method is available - `getComposedField()`. This takes in a simple data structure (or even a string) and will return the structure needed to compose a query.

### New

- An additional `queryUtils` object is available with the following functions:
  - `function getComposedField(input: string | ComposeFieldInput): FieldType`
  - `function getFlattenedFields(query: Query, isAggregateResult?: boolean): string[]`
  - `function isSubquery(query: Query | Subquery): query is Subquery`
  - Look at the README and refer to the unit tests for example usage.
